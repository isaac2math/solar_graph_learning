## For details, see the paper "Ultrahigh dimensional instrument detection using graph learning: an application to high dimensional GIS-census data for house pricing" by Ning Xu (https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15769).


## I applied solar and score-based learning to high dimensional GIS-census data for house pricing. 
> - The learning result provide a very sparse linear model with high prediction power.
> - The learning result recovers an intuitive, sparse and statistically significant causal structure from the high dimensional data
> - The learning result is intuitive and confirmed many empirical statistical issue like grouping effect, endogeneity and instrument selection.

> the results are included in the following files
> - *costcom.py, simulator.py and solar.py* are the solar package
> - *Houseprice_2010_linear.ipynb, Houseprice_2010_log.ipynb* are the variable selection result of solar compared to lasso and elastic net.
> - *bnlearn_structure_test.ipynb* are the instrument selection result based on probablistic graph learning
